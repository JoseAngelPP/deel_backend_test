    """For many of our related fields (departments, locations, reports_to, etc)
    it is vitally important that the assigned field is within the same
    organization.

    DRF provides very little to enforce this besides using validators after
    submission (which is already included in a few serializers). However, the
    HTML forms in the API View are able to see the possible querysets, which by
    default were Model.objects.all() for most SlugRelatedFields. This causes a
    data leak were a user could see emails, departments, etc across Companies.

    To remedy, we need to reduce the filterset with DRF's API View (or anyone
    else) asks for it.

    This Class is used to filter down a queryset to only be within the
    caller's org. It can be dynamically queried during the instantiation of
    the class.

    Passing in the relation_field, as the dundered relation for the query. This
    class will filter to make sure that passed relation_field is the company
    on the calling user.

    Pass the "*" attribute to self-reference company, for when the related
    field is the company object.
